# dog_breed_predition
Transfer learning CNN model to classify dog breed

*This was a project during my Udacity AI Programming with Python(AIPND) Nano-Degree 
*I used Pre-trained CNN models to train and predict a dog breed classifier network with up to 93.3% predictive accuracy.
*I also investigated the performance of different models on the training data. 
*The models I worked with were Alexnet, ResNet, VGG.
*The network was built using pytorch
*There is a python script  to extract and present the final results in concise, tabular form

To run:
       sh run_models_batch.sh
   
   results:
        final_results-summary.txt
